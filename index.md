# Aryan Yadav

I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science at Cornell University, where my specialization lies in low-latency distributed systems and kernel architecture. Using C++, I focus on reliability (theoretically proven correctness measures) and micro-optimizations and leverage techniques like network stack bypassing with DPDK and RDMA to reduce latency. My research also aims to modify kernel features to better accommodate high-performance computing tasks - scheduler optimization, custom memory allocation and paging strategies.

Following a successful summer internship, I will be joining Millennium as a software engineer in July 2024 to work on their low-latency order management system for equities. This role allows me to apply my academic expertise to real-world financial markets, emphasizing both speed and reliability in the execution of equity orders.
